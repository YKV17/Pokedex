# Pokedex
Welcome to the Jetpack Compose Pokemon App repository! This Android application showcases the power of Jetpack Compose, a modern Android UI toolkit, by providing an interactive and visually appealing way to explore the world of Pok√©mon.

## Features

- **Pokemon List**: The app fetches a comprehensive list of Pok√©mon from an external data source and displays them in a scrollable list using Jetpack Compose's `LazyColumn`.

- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for your favorite Pok√©mon using the built-in search bar. The app dynamically filters the list as you type, making it effortless to find the Pok√©mon you're looking for.

- **Pokemon Details**: Tap on any Pok√©mon in the list to view detailed information, including its name, type, abilities, and image. The details screen demonstrates how to navigate to a new Composable screen and pass data between them.

- **Dependency Injection**: Utilizes a dependency injection framework, such as Hilt, for managing dependencies and promoting code scalability.

- **Theming and UI Customization**: The app showcases theming capabilities, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes effortlessly. You can also explore how to customize the UI components in Jetpack Compose to match your app's branding.

- **Error Handling**: Demonstrates best practices for error handling, including loading and error states, to provide a smooth and resilient user experience.

- **Network Integration**: Shows how to make network requests and handle API responses gracefully using libraries like Retrofit.
